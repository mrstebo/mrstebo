# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

## Who am I? :thinking:

I am a software developer from Manchester, UK. I have been programming since 2010 when I received an apprenticeship from Hitachi Automotive Systems.

Since then I have been exploring lots of different languages and frameworks, and have gained understanding of Azure and AWS cloud infrastructure.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on API integrations, mobile applications and cloud infrastructure
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Xamarin Forms for cross-platform mobile development
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects that help society
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with large scale mobile application architecture
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/steven-atkinson-79977516/) is probably the best place :wink:

***I am also available for freelance development/architecture***

***Disclaimer: I am NOT a full time contractor...yet*** :relaxed:
